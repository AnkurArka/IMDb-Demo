Summary of the assignment - We have setup the code with standard iOS libraries and architecture. On movies list screen we are capturing the data through IMDB movie API and through core data framework it's stored locally. When a user will come to the app again those movies will be initially checked at local database and then if any changes to the list it will refresh the local db through API. 

At the next screen, we are loading the movie details through the movie details API call.
